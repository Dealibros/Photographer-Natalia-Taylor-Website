I had more fun working with Natalia on this project than I ever could have imagined. She truly took the time to get to know my perfect appearance and it shows in how perfect my portrait is for me. I can’t wait to do another one!"</p>

You spend a year planning for 1 day, the most important and expensive day of your life and all you are left with is the photos.  After you have your venue, finding the perfect photographer is the most important choice you will make and I can honestly say they don’t come any better than Natalia."</p>

She is everywhere, but at the same time never in the way. The way Natalia works lets you go through the day without ever feeling as if anyone is taking your photo. Our photos are insane… they belong in Cosmopolitan or Vogue – every image a piece of art in it’s own right. WOW!!!"</p>

I tasked           Natalia with finding me a dress that was right for my place in life but still a "wow". She asked         great questions about how I wanted to look. The key words I gave her were chic, subtly sexy,         timeless, sophisticated, and not cheap – all while staying between $300-$500."</p>
